SLON is an artistic project involving three researchers with dubious employment prospects. We combine disturbing content with surprising musical developments to tell the stories that lurch covertly behind the plenum. Some people have compared our style to Comus. Our guitarist calls himself Robert, but is really The Spirit Quinkin. Robert recently celebrated his 40,000th birthday. Hooray! His true nature is mysterious and manifestly unnatural. By contrast our bass player, Adam is made solely of organic matter, although we now know he was reincarnated several times. The singer is called Mike. Mike is unfortunately both organic and mortal, but says he once shook hands with Greg Rutherford. There is no evidence for this claim. 
None of us care what you think about our music, but if you have any specific complaints, email us at musicalslon@gmail.com. Then we can arrange a meeting on a multistorey carpark where we will fight you. The loser will be thrown off the car park.
