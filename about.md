LON is an artistic project involving three researchers with dubious employment prospects. We combine disturbing content with surprising musical developments to tell the stories that lurch covertly behind the plenum. 

Our guitarist calls himself Robert, but is really The Spirit Quinkin. Robert recently celebrated his 40,000th birthday. Hooray! His true nature is mysterious and manifestly unnatural. By contrast, our bass player Adam is made solely of organic matter, although we now know he was reincarnated several times. The singer is called Mike. Mike is unfortunately both organic and mortal, but says he once shook hands with Greg Rutherford. There is no evidence for this claim. 

This project involves music, visual art, and the construction of an elaborate polytheistic belief system that will be revealed in multiple stages. SLON is therefore a selfless and righteous endeavour that we are pursuing for the good of mankind, as well as for our own amusement. 

If you have any specific complaints about our music, email us at <a href="mailto:{{ site.email }}">{{ site.email }}</a>. Then, in accordance with our code of honour, you can arrange a meeting on a multistorey carpark of your choice where we will fight you. The loser will be thrown off the car park. Be aware that Adam knows Kung Fu.
