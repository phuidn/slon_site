SLON is an artistic project involving three researchers with dubious employment prospects. We combine disturbing content with surprising musical developments to tell the stories that lurch covertly behind the plenum. Our guitarist calls himself Robert, but is really The Spirit Quinkin. Robert recently celebrated his 40,000th birthday. Hooray! His true nature is mysterious and manifestly unnatural. By contrast our bass player, Adam is made solely of organic matter, although we now know he was reincarnated several times. The singer is called Mike. Mike is unfortunately both organic and mortal, but says he once shook hands with Greg Rutherford. There is no evidence for this claim. 

This is a purely selfless endeavour that we are pursuing for our own amusement. If you have any specific complaints about our music, email us at musicalslon@gmail.com. Then we can arrange a meeting on a multistorey carpark where we will fight you. The loser will be thrown off the car park. Be aware that Adam knows Kung Fu.
