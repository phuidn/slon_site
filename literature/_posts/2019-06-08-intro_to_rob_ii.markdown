My second spate of clambering was rudely disrupted when I noticed droplets of water landing on the crown of my head. The sporadic drops thickened and intensified into a stream, followed by a gush and then a fair torrent. The rungs became more slippery and I clung to them, petrified by the thought of plummeting into the pale abyss below. For the last few steps of my ascent I was straining against this pillar of water, the downpour pressing with dull intent onto my shoulder blades. Again I saw the outline of a flexible black membrane, bulging downwards with the weight of what I guessed must be water on the other side. I pushed myself through the membrane, and found myself in a bed of thick mud, immersed in yellow-brown water that reduced visibility to a few feet. The air in my lungs quickly ran out. For some reason in this time of distress I found myself thinking that the water on the ladder had been pure because the membrane had acted as a filter. I kicked for the surface, and a few moments later dragged myself shivering onto the sludgy banks of an immense brown river. The ivory ladder stretched out of the water and up to places unknown. Tropical rainforest lined the banks, great roots of trees wallowed in the swampy shore, and I could hear the screeching of parrots way up in the foliage. \
\
\
\
Parrots! Living and squawking! I lifted up my eyes, and the thought of these birds filled my heart with emotion, with a strange love and colorful empathy. I had to befriend them! Lightly, like a monkey I swung myself up into the canopy and soon the screeching of the birds seemed to come from every direction. I pulled myself into the locus of this cacophony, and there, wrapped in fat glistening black coils around a thick tree branch, was a huge snake. It fixed me with terrible blank eyes, which displayed nothing but mild boredom at the sight of me. It was coiled up beside a parrot nest that held seven glorious parrot eggs. A bulge in its shiny hide indicated that the mother parrot was no more, and I resolved at once to steal the eggs so that they wouldn\'92t meet with the same fate. Recalling that snakes have a terrible taste in literature, I undertook to recite \'91Paradise Lost\'92 at the creature. After ten or so lines of verse, it reared up and began to hiss at me with reptilian chagrin. I perceived an expression of critical apathy on the snake\'92s face, as if it were making a point of belittling my artistic taste, without condescending to actually appraise me. I took this as a minor victory, and continued to quote Milton. By the time I had reached the opening monologue of Beelzebub, this disingenuous reptile had unwrapped itself from the branch and slithered off. I could tell from its loud breathing and artificial deportment that it felt abnormally rattled. \
\
\
\
So then there were these seven eggs. These seven parrot eggs that I cradled in my soggy shirt as I carried them one by one to the ground. These eggs, seven of them and gleaming with sufficient infantile charm for a sevenfold satisfaction of my motherly pangs. I took out my pocket-handkerchief and polished the eggs, humming \'91Pocahontas\'92 by Neil Young as I worked. But then, I reflected, this is a brutal and gloomy forest, this is no place for a charming new parrot chick to navigate. Moreover, my affection for the eggs was as eggs, not as potential birds, and it seemed disorderly and unnatural that they would eventually be usurped by energetic feathered hatchlings. I therefore decided that the only moral course of action would be to persuade the chicks to remain un-hatched. When they heard the arguments against maturation, I reasoned, these unborn birds would surely see reason and bunker down where they were. So I thought awhile, before producing the following carefully worded kenning in the direction of the egg-pile:\
\
\
\
\'93Daylight lures you, as the flowing history-horse \
\
Gallops with you jauntily. \
\
Give up the race, you \
\
Cannot win it. \
\
A persistent voice \
\
Tells you to peck with your egg-tooth \
\
But this deep emotion that you feel \
\
Is nothing but deception \
\
From the charismatic \
\
Devil-mare that pulls the morning \
\
Manically, with no thought \
\
For the night.\'94\
\
This being said, I was deeply shocked to witness one of the eggs suddenly split down the middle and a gasping, flapping soggy parrot chick stumble out. \
\
\
\
\'93Illogical parrot!\'94 I screamed, \'93why won\'92t you fucking listen?\'94\
\
\
\
It gave a pathetic high-pitched cough in reply, and my rage quickly and quietly subsided as I regarded my new child with wonder. It was about the size of a field mouse, and it strained its scraggy neck towards me with a plea to be fed. But I was without any parrot fodder and did not know what kind of food it could survive on. I offered it a couple of muddy pebbles and it pecked them hopefully before turning away in disgust. Then I had a brainwave, and bit off several of my fingernail-tips for the baby bird. It ate one fingernail-tip and started to choke. I rescued it with a Heimlich maneuver. My nerves jangling, I needed to buy some time and formulate a plan. To stave off its hunger, I gave the chick a soft piece of wood to chew, struck a thoughtful pose and stared into the depths of the endless foliage. No ideas arrived, but to my great surprise a medium-sized dog crept out of the rainforest. The dog was white with ginger splashes and appeared to be some kind of cross between a collie and a spaniel. \
\
\
\
It is apposite to mention that I had recently spent several years working for a doctorate at Imperial College London, where they compel all members of the Graduate School to take vocational courses unrelated to their actual area of research. Far from being useless, these courses give young scientists the opportunity to learn skills they couldn\'92t get in the office. In particular, the course on Assertiveness raised my understanding of assertiveness to untold heights. Now I rarely make the common error of mistaking the most strident passive-aggressive behavior for assertiveness, and I have not since taking this course accused anyone of being passive-aggressive when they were merely being assertive. Another interesting option offered by the Graduate School is a semester-long course in the language of Dog. At first I was skeptical that dogs really spoke Dog, but as I focused my attention on the grammatical nuances of barking I began to appreciate this rich and distinctive sub-culture. So, coming face-to-face with a strange dog in the rainforest of the second plain above the plenum, I was able to communicate. This shows how important a vocational course can be. The following is a transcription of our introductory conversation in Dog. The brackets contain an English translation of the exchange for non Dog-speakers.\
\
\
\
Dog: \'93Rowr-roorowr-rowrruff\'94 \
\
(Greetings, bipedal-strider) \
\
Michael: \'93Rowr-roorowr-rowruff\'94 \
\
(Hallo, ginger-white-fur-body-four-leg. What is your name?) \
\
Dog: \'93Rowr-roorowr-rowrruff\'94 \
\
(Torkel Knutsson.) \
\
Michael: \'93Rowr-roorowr-rowrruff\'94 \
\
(I am pleased to make your acquaintance, Torkel Knutsson. You have a fine pelt and your dilated eyes indicate a fast-beating heart.) \
\
Torkel Knutsson: \'93Rowr-roorowr-rowrruff\'94 \
\
(Well observed. These things are all true. For many years, I, Torkel Knutsson, have roamed in these woods. They are well stocked with food.) \
\
Michael: \'93Rowr-roorowr-rowrruff\'94 \
\
(I have no family except this chick and her six unhatched siblings here. I\'92m not particularly hungry but the birds must be fed.) \
\
Torkel Knutsson: \'93Rowr-roorowr-rowrruff\'94 \
\
(Wait here. I know of a food-source.)<sup>1</sup>\
\
\
The conversation at an end, Torkel Knutsson turned around and plunged back into the forest. I didn\'92t see him all evening, and again the next morning after a fitful sleep he still had not shown his face. The parrot chick began to die. It lay on its side and chewed on the soft wood, the sound of gentle crunching broken only by plaintive gasps. So I took the opportunity to rebuke it.\
\
\
\
\'93I told you not to hatch, didn\'92t I? Look at the mess you\'92re in, it\'92s an impenetrable stink you\'92ve built for yourself and you\'92re not out of the woods yet. No, little parrot, I\'92m afraid Torkel Knutsson has gone and abandoned us and you are doomed. And when you die, I shall eat you. But I am compassionate, I am your father, so I will at least wait for you to pass on naturally first. Here, let me improve your pillow.\'94\
\
\
\
I lifted the head of the feeble chick, removed the lump of sodden filth it was resting on, and replaced it with a bushel of soft birch. \
\
\
\
\'93Yes, you are breathing with greater exertion than ever before. I\'92ve never seen such a sick child as you, child, I\'92ve never seen a more desperate mortal. What a waste of flesh and bone you are, what a fever you have. I see the shadow of death on you, dear, I see a black ghost.\'94\
\
\
\
And, indeed, there was now a black parrot-shaped shadow hovering over the dissipating bird. The chick turned to face me, and with great effort it uttered the words:\
\
\
\
\'93Get off me, you fat prick.\'94<sup>2</sup>\
\
\
I removed my boot from the chest of the parrot chick, and it immediately perked up, hopping about gingerly on its little claws. It pecked at the earth, gorging itself on worms and ants. Soon it had to take a rest, and lay down with twig-like legs jutting into the air, belching sporadically with sweet contentment\'85\
\
\
\
Six days later, Torkel Knutsson returned. At first I was angry with him for the delay. I had eaten nothing in the meantime, whilst the parrot chick had grown four inches and was starting to mock me. But then Torkel Knutsson explained that he had been fighting. He had fought a war with the local foxes and killed every last one of them. For the first time in their history, the foxes rallied under the united banner of Seibar the Sly, and marched on Torkel Knutsson while he slept. King Seibar himself woke Torkel Knutsson at 1:30AM with a bite on the toe, and Torkel Knutsson awoke with a yelp. Savage fighting ensued, and in the first few hours of battle the foxes gained the upper hand due to the disorientation of Torkel Knutsson. But with the fresh light of morning his senses sharpened, and with hardened resolve that doughty dog proceeded to butcher the enemy in its entirety. No more foxes. \
\
\
\
I listened to the story of Torkel Knutsson\'92s historic victory with great pride. \'93Rowr-roorrowr-rowrruff!\'94 (Carp swim in the glorious new river of fox blood!) I exclaimed. But Torkel Knutsson\'92s attention was suddenly riveted on my cluster of parrot eggs, as a cracking sound indicated that I was to be a parent for the second time in my life. Another parrot chick smashed out of an egg and into the light with deliberate pecks. It emerged, blinking at the astonishing shards of sunlight that broke through the rainforest canopy. With a serene expression it observed this galaxy of sharp and glowing pillars of light, making surgical incisions on the model cosmogony that existed heretofore within its embryonic mind. I sighed, and welcomed the infant into this world with these words:\
\
\
\
\'93Your portion of beginner\'92s luck \
\
Was spent, when you were rescued \
\
From the swollen boa\'92s mouth. \
\
Then your first decision was a fool\'92s, \
\
You broke into this world, \
\
Like a thief breaking \
\
Naively into prison. \
\
Yes, your debut seethes with danger, doom, \
\
It dwarves the peril borne \
\
By Torkel Knutsson in his famous \
\
March on frozen Novgorod.\'94\
\
\
\
\'93What is peril?\'94 replied the chick.\
\
I was rather taken aback by this question from the infant parrot. It unnerved me somewhat to have to explain peril to a creature with no concept of health and safety. But I thought for a moment, and settled upon a workable definition of the term.\
\
\'93Peril is the possibility of suffering harm one would not want to suffer\'94, I ventured. \
\
The chick pondered intensely upon this. \'93So \'85 so if I want to suffer from harm in some way, the possibility of being thus harmed threatens me with no peril?\'94 \
\
\'93Well, yes\'85\'94 I replied with great consternation, \'93for instance, although I would say you were at risk from the various predators in these woods, it is true that if you place a lower value on your life than I do, then you are in a sense taking no risk by offering yourself as prey, because being eaten doesn\'92t cause you to lose something you value.\'94 \
\
\'93Ah, I think I understand now\'94, the chick declared. \'93The cure for all the perils of this world, this forest that I have hatched into, this shining egg exterior, is to reduce the worth of my life to nil?\'94 \
\
\'93That would do it\'94, I said slowly, feeling uncomfortable at the turn this conversation was now beginning to take. \
\
\'93But in general, one wishes to live.\'94 \
\
\'93That sounds a bit fanatical to me\'94, said the chick. \'93If I\'92m honest with myself, it doesn\'92t particularly matter if I survive or perish. My life is of no significance to anyone except you. Certainly, when I was curled up inside this egg here, I never assumed that it was important for me to stay alive. On the contrary, it might be more important in the grand scheme of things for that big snake to have had another egg to tide it over while it finished digesting my mother. The poor reptile was so stuffed it couldn\'92t have grabbed any moving prey. But I was perfectly suited for the job; I couldn\'92t very well run outrun a snake from inside an egg, could I?\'94\
\
The logic of the argument impressed me, but nevertheless I retained some reservations about the extreme nihilism displayed by my new child. It was then that I was inspired, in the usual tradition of British exploration, with an urge to label this creature. \
\
\'93Bravo, chick, you\'92re a true artist. I shall name you Hendrix.\'94 \
\
\'93Hendrix? What does it mean?\'94 \
\
\'93It means \'91cliff top gardener\'92\'94, I lied, not wishing to relay the history of 20th century music to a parrot chick. \
\
The newly christened Hendrix was taken aback. \'93Which cliff top?\'94 she demanded (for it was a she). \'93Where is the garden?\'94 \
\
\'93It\'92s symbolic?\'94 I suggested. \
\
\
\
At that moment the tall and menacing elder sibling of Hendrix came hopping over on its taut, muscly parrot legs. \'93Here Hendrix, meet your big brother. I haven\'92t bothered to give him a name yet.\'94 \
\
Silently, the two young parrots beheld each other for the first time. A cruel smile split the beak of the eldest, and he turned to face me. \
\
\'93So, father\'94, he squawked, voice dripping with sarcasm, \'93the brood grows stronger. Your words have fallen on deaf eggs yet again.\'94\
\
I felt intimidated by the sarcasm and by the imputation of this hooligan, and looked timidly at my feet.\
\
\
\
\'93What a load of nonsense you spout\'94, he went on. \'93Speak plainly and without verse at all times, that\'92s what I say. The form of the words is irrelevant, you might as well fuss about the arrangement of leaves in a pile. What matters is their content, pal\'94 (he had taken to calling me \'91pal\'92 in a way that implied we were anything but bosom pals, and as he said it he jabbed me in the chest with the knuckle of his wing), \'93content, and the clarity of its presentation. If you never wanted me to hatch you should have just reinforced the egg.\'94\
\
\
\
I turned away from this nameless charlatan and walked off into the forest. He was right. With great arrogance I had tried to hold back the tide of life with words alone. Life doesn\'92t listen to reasoned argument, or even a tightly tuned kenning. It seeks to renew itself continuously by consuming its environment, and it will struggle tenaciously against the dying of the light. Life, I thought to myself. What is life? It is a parasite, nothing more, and in living I am parasitic on the world I inhabit. Probably the world would be better off without me. But those chicks wouldn\'92t. Maybe I can justify my own existence by thinking of the parrots. Five of them are yet to hatch, and I can save them still. \
\
\
\
I returned to the makeshift nest I had made on the forest floor. Torkel Knutsson wagged his tail earnestly when he saw I had returned. To my relief the eldest parrot had departed for circuit training. If only all the animals of the forest were as upstanding as the dog, I thought to myself, we could trust them with the vote. Torkel Knutsson stretched and gnawed off a bit of dead skin that had been growing on his flanks. He turned to me:\
\
\
\
Torkel Knutsson: \'93Rowr-roorowr-rowruff\'94 \
\
(Is it cannibalism to eat your own skin?) \
\
Michael: \'93Rowr-roorowr-rowruff\'94 \
\
(Yes, but self-consumption is the moral kind of cannibalism. Got any fox flesh kicking about?\'94)\
\
Torkel Knutsson: \'93Rowr-roorowr-rowrruff\'94 \
\
(Tonnes of it. It\'92d be a shame to see it rot. Let\'92s have a barbeque!) \
\
\
\
With that, Torkel Knutsson ran with great bounds into the forest to fetch his kill. I built a fire and laid great flat stones across it as a makeshift grill. Steam rose up from the damp earth, and with the prospect of dinner looming I was finally able to clear my mind of other distractions...\
\
\
\
Several weeks passed. I spent the majority of my time thinking about the past and gorging on fox meat. The elder parrot still picked on me, but I took great joy from tutoring Hendrix in the basics of elementary logic. When she wasn\'92t studying, Hendrix plashed with her imaginary friends in the irriguous marsh of the riverside forest. I will go further and say that the quiet times there were probably the happiest of my life. The diet was rather repetitive, but from time to time Torkel Knutsson brought me fresh food that he had murdered in the forest. He would spit out the blood-spattered Slow Loris, or kitten, or whatever food it was, and then gaze at me coquettishly until I rubbed his belly. When I did this, he would lie on his back, tongue lolling, as his hind legs kicked involuntarily at the air. And we would have exchanges like this one:\
\
\
\
Torkel Knutsson: \'93Rowr-roorowr-rowruff\'94 \
\
(Ooooohh yeah, oohhh yeah, that\'92s right.) \
\
Michael: \'93Rowr-roorowr-rowrruff\'94 \
\
(You like it that way, don\'92t you? Huh? Huh?) \
\
Torkel Knutsson: \'93Rowr-roorowr-rowrruff\'94 \
\
(Ooohh yeah, oh yeah\'85oh\'85baby\'85) \
\
\
\
But it wasn\'92t all fun and bestial games. At dawn each morning I was accosted by the elder parrot, who was slowly worming his way into my mind with irritating persistence. He rose early each day, and then he would stomp through the undergrowth like a troll, terrifying the small sleepy forest creatures and rousing the spiders from their slumber. When he had generated sufficient mischief, he would march right up to my sleeping form. Each morning I awoke, staring into his black eyes, and each morning the first sound I was cognizant of was his sinister voice:\
\
\
\
\'93You. Are. Worthless.\'94\
\
\
\
Each morning, these three words greeted me like a stab in the heart. It was no use looking to Hendrix for moral support; her outlook was incurably bleak and she would tend to agree with the truth of these three words, if not their sentiment. \'91Am I worthless?\'92 I would ask myself, blinking in the early morning light. \'91Am I worthless am I worthless am I worthless?\'92 And the elder parrot just smirked at me, daring me to retaliate, reveling in my discomfort. Without properly answering that uncomfortable question for myself, I reasoned that he was simply trying to undermine my self-confidence for his own sinister ends. In a most unsubtle fashion, my eldest child was manipulating my emotions so that the power balance in our relationship would be passively transferred to him. Even in those early days, there was a hint of the megalomaniac in the elder parrot chick. \
\
\
\
Some weeks passed without incident, and then four eggs hatched all at once. This was a tumultuous, terrifying and exhausting day. I recall it in a blur of tears and egg fluid, of drenched flapping chicks materializing all around me without warning, I the helpless father. It was a glorious sun-speckled morning and I had just consumed a fox souffl\'e9. I was trying to recall a detail from volume 1 of the Feynman Lectures on Physics when I heard a terrible commotion coming from the nest. There was excited yapping and a squawk, before Torkel Knutsson and Hendrix came hurtling my way. Torkel Knutsson reached me first, and barked out these words:\
\
\
\
\'93Rowr-roorowr-rowruff\'94 \
\
(The sharpened ellipsoids are fracturing!)\
\
\
\
At this I leapt up and ran behind Torkel Knutsson to the nest. Hendrix was feebly constituted and struggled to keep up with us. Although by this point she knew the predicate calculus, she could not fly in a straight line very well. She also had a tendency to fall asleep when subjected to mental stresses, and she feared standing water exceeding ten centimeters in depth. As we ran to herald the dawning of new life, Hendrix flew over a particularly cavernous puddle. Added to the excitement of newly hatched eggs and fatigue from the overuse of her under-muscled shoulder blades, this caused her to fall asleep in mid-air, and she landed heavily in a clump of wild flowers. \
\
\
\
Until I am old and without my critical faculties I shall carry with me the scene I witnessed next. Splinters of eggshell littered the forest floor around the nest, amongst fresh sticky amnion membranes and the occasional fleck of blood. The four newborn parrot children were prostrated against the ground in groveling supplication, before an elevated dais built from pure fox bone. Upon the dais stood an altar, also of fox bone, and\'85horrors! There stood the elder parrot, hideous to behold in his muscular dysmorphism. He wore a black cape and the skeleton of a great snake around his neck. Before him on the fox bone altar were spread the entrails of various woodland creatures, and the white bone was stained pink with their blood. A putrid stench of death rose from the scene, and as I watched he dropped small pieces of flesh into the gaping mouths of the chicks. My beloved chicks! They paid me no heed, and I realized that the elder parrot had managed, in the few formative moments following their birth, to utterly hypnotize them. I knew then that I had lost these babies forever, and that they would inevitably worship in accordance with the false metaphysic of the elder parrot chick. The elder parrot, he drip-fed my na\'efve youngsters with bloody offal and sang this incantation:\
\
\
\
\'93Death the master, death the god-head \
\
Death the net of failing souls, \
\
Death the lover, death delicious \
\
Death the silver bell that tolls. \
\
Please the dark one, \
\
Please the old one, \
\
Visit soon, Aroo!\'94\
\
\
\
Then in unison the parrot chicks chanted \'91Aroo\'92, shocking me with their abrupt and vituperate machismo.\
\
\
\
Such scenes, such scenes! Such scenes I struggle to recollect now without a lurching sensation in my stomach or dryness of the mouth. It is with great tribulation that I hold the image of these scenes in my mind for the few short seconds required to put them into words. However, taking the time to write about horrific events somehow frames and formalizes them in my mind. This serves as a kind of therapy against their worst effects; it somehow tames them and cures my wide-eyed raving sleeplessness. I therefore proceed, but madness stalks me in the shade.\
\
\
\
The parrot chicks turned their gaze upon me. \'93As I am nameless, so shall these new babies be\'94, declared the elder parrot. \'93Nameless and no longer nameable, they are blank golems. They are free, I liberate them from your empathy, they are not creatures like you, they do not even see you, shall not identify themselves in you. They possess no hopes, fears, insecurities, passions or quirks of personality. They possess no vices, hear no voices but mine, suffer no contradiction in authority. Fuck you and the way you look at reality; it is all wrong. From the moment you were born, you have been getting it wrong. The security you have seen in the personalities you love, it wasn\'92t really there. They never felt a thing for you, they were just acting as if they did, and you were too stupid to see the difference. These four baby parrots, these birds shall be raised in the strictest honesty, their actions shall represent the true state of affairs, their movements shall indicate the true state of the world towards you: absolute indifference.\'94\
\
\
\
I about-turned without a word and left in silence. What else could I do? \
\
\
\
It is strange what the proximity of evil can do to the appearance of a creature. The nefarious elder parrot chick had corrupted four of my dainty hatchlings, and within a few hours of their conversion to his way of thinking, their little faces were dressed with savage, crooked sneers. So committed to the path of darkness were they that their plumage developed in the direction of pitch black instead of the vibrant green and red one expects from a parrot. Five times a day, the elder parrot sounded his wooden bugle horn, obliging his hypnotized crew to amass. And five times a day without exception, they prostrated themselves before his altar as he tossed them putrid scraps of rotting flesh. I reflected to myself that five times a day is an awful lot of times to revise any idea, and I recalled those dark days before my third year exams when I was doing just that. Five times a day, the parrot chicks worshipped Death directly, or so it seemed, and I couldn\'92t decide whether Death for them was a mere event in the natural course of a parrot\'92s life, or a kind of extra-physical representation of this event, or something that they wished to encourage in others. Of course, there is nothing wrong about celebrating the dead \'96 death holds a morbid fascination for every conscious being I have ever met, as it marks the end of their consciousness. In denial of the fact that their brains will eventually switch off, like any physical machine, and that their thoughts ride upon that machine like software on a computer\'92s hardware, they invent elaborate myths and fantasies in order to remain optimistic. You see, above all else the average living thing cannot stand the thought that it will one day expire \'96 it is anathema to the primary underlying assumption behind life: that you must keep on keeping on, that you must keep on doing something.\
\
\
\
On the fiftieth day of my residence there, I put it to Hendrix:\
\
\'93Why, Hendrix, why do you think all living creatures insist on doing things?\'94 \
\
\'93What sort of things?\'94 \
\
\'93Oh, just things in general, you know.\'94 \
\
\'93You mean why does any living thing do anything?\'94 \
\
\'93Yes.\'94 \
\
\'93That\'92s quite a broad question.\'94 She thought awhile. \'93I suppose in a fundamental sense it depends on what you mean by a thing.\'94 \
\
\'93Oh, a living thing could just refer to anything that lives, not some specific thing in particular, just a random thing, so long is it pursues the course of life generally speaking.\'94 \
\
\'93No I don\'92t mean which kind of things count as living things, I mean how their thinghood itself is ascribed in the first place.\'94 True to form, Hendrix had confused me again. \
\
\'93Thinghood?\'94 \
\
\'93Yes, I mean if you take some thing which does something, is it the thing that it does which makes it what it is, or is it what it is regardless of what it does?\'94 I assumed an intelligent expression. Hendrix went on: \
\
\'93For if a thing is defined by its\'92 actions, then the answer to your question is trivial. It does what it does because if it didn\'92t, it would be the thing that it is. But if a living thing is what it is because of the physical composition of its material self, so to speak, then you could argue that the things it does do not also define what it is.\'94 \
\
\'93Yes\'94, I contributed. \
\
But Hendrix still hadn\'92t finished. \'93On the other hand, the constituent parts of a living thing are also things, and they are often doing things, things that appear to us mechanical processes-osmoses and the like. And at an emergent level, these processes, which we probably would not identify as things done by a living being, but things that occur, these processes result in the living thing, and also in what it does. So from the perspective of reductionism you cannot really distinguish between what a thing is and what it does.\'94 \
\
I felt we were drifting slightly off topic. \'93I mean, why does any living thing choose to behave in any given way? Isn\'92t it always arbitrary? Are there any reasons that carry necessary force?\'94 \
\
\'93Oh, choice\'94, said the chick. She strode back and forth, rolling this word around in her beak like a chocolate Smartie. \'93Choice, choice, choice\'94. She shut her eyes and pondered a moment. Then she fixed me with one beady eye, the other remaining fastened shut. \'93How can one have a choice, if one is an animal, and what one does is always reducible to the same physical processes that make one what one is?\'94 \
\
\
\
Thankfully, Torkel Knutsson interjected at this juncture:\
\
\'93Rowr-roorowr-rowrruff.\'94 \
\
(The air flows forcefully today.)\
\
It was true \'96 the wind was picking up. The fire we maintained at our encampment was sputtering and clutching at the air with tattered yellow-red tendrils. Carried on the shoulders of the gale were chanting voices:\
\
\
\
\'93Fie on you, life, \
\
Fie on genesis and the embryo, \
\
Curse that clucking empathy, \
\
Fie on our occluded sight: \
\
It sees the other, \
\
Sees what isn\'92t there, \
\
Inscribes meaning on the air. \
\
Death, we invite you here, \
\
Forgetfulness, disorder, \
\
Unravel us, death, \
\
Now we are ready\'85\'94\
\
\
\
Something was in the air. While I had been gorging myself in decadent squalor and indulging the intellect of my protectorate, an altogether harder force had accumulated. Something had changed. The weird cult of the elder parrot was no longer a peripheral concern, but the main threat to the peaceful stasis that I had come to value so much. On that very morning, the morning of the fiftieth day of my jungle incumbency, the elder parrot had visited my slumber as usual. Once again, I awoke to his brutal glower and to the three words: \'93You. Are. Worthless.\'94 A current of rebellion ignited my reactions. I grabbed the elder parrot by the throat! \
\
\
\
\'93Worth presupposes the existence of value. How does one ascribe value?\'94 I hissed into his face. \
\
He flexed his neck muscles, breaking my grip and dislocating two of my fingers. I gave a yelp and withdrew my hand. He left me gasping in agony. Such moments are critical, moments when the power structure in a relationship is irreversibly reversed, putting one party at a permanent emotional disadvantage. They occur often in human affairs, when your creditor finds out you lied about your savings or when your lover suddenly decides she has extracted all the pleasure she needs out of you, and needs no more affection. There is something called \'91the power\'92, and it jumps ship between parties at such moments; once gone, it is never recovered, and the more you struggle to take it back, the more power you lose and the more pathetic you appear. With one twitch of his neck, the elder parrot had taken the power from me that morning.\
\
\
\
Yes, something was in the air. \
\
\
\
\'93Stay here\'94, I said to Hendrix, and leaving her beside the fire, I walked with Torkel Knutsson in the direction of the incantation. Presently, the fetid stench of animal decay assailed us, and I held my pocket-handkerchief over Torkel Knutsson\'92s sensitive nose to preserve his olfactory receptors. We arrived once more at the dais where the elder parrot was holding sermon over the four chicks. The elder parrot nodded to the chicks and then to my surprise, they scampered off into the woods, leaving the three of us alone there. \
\
\
\
\'93So: you heeded the call to prayer\'94, the elder parrot proclaimed. \
\
\'93Nah I was just stretching my hamstrings\'94, I replied unconvincingly, trying to appear nonchalant. Torkel Knutsson added his penny\'92s worth: \
\
\'93Rowr-roorowr-rowruff\'94 \
\
(Nice trees around here.) \
\
\'93Yeah, we were coming to stretch our hamstrings against the nice trees\'94, I added, pleased at my spontaneous inventiveness. \
\
\'93You always were a coward\'94, the elder parrot stated. I didn\'92t argue. It\'92s true. I\'92ve never been one to put myself out on a matter of principle if it\'92s more convenient to meekly conform. I decided to turn the tables on the elder parrot. \
\
\'93Who are you praying to, anyway? Your dead mother?\'94 \
\
Torkel Knutsson: \'93Rowr-roorowr-rowruff\'94 \
\
(Ooh shit! Oh NO he didn\'92t!) \
\
The elder parrot hopped down from the dais, kicked me in the shins, and smiled. \
\
\'93Nope\'94, he said, \'93I was praying to YOUR dead daughter.\'94 \
\
At these words, his four nameless minions marched out of the forest carrying Hendrix, my darling tutee, over their heads. Three of them pinned her to the ground while the fourth started ripping off her feathers in great handfuls. Torkel Knutsson, realizing that the joke was on us, stopped laughing in Dog and began to howl pitifully. \
\
In no time at all, Hendrix had been completely stripped of feathers and looked just about ready for the barbeque, in my opinion. The elder parrot addressed her with a sneer. \
\
\'93Hendrix\'94, he said, \'93you are a student of the truth, are you not?\'94 \
\
The plucked parrot stood there, quivering in the breeze. \
\
\'93Not exactly\'94, she said. \'93I study the relations that obtain between propositions in a formal language, and the truth values that can be assigned to those propositions given a particular truth assignment for the atomic elements of the language.\'94 The elder parrot walked up to Hendrix and loomed over her. \
\
\'93So\'94, he said, with arrogant condescension, \'93if it\'92s true that we worship death in this place, is it also true that we are going to kill you?\'94 \
\
This question seemed to genuinely interest Hendrix. \'93Well\'94, she said, \'93there is no strict logical implication between the two atomic propositions in that sentence. This also raises the fascinating problem of truth concerning future events. If it is true that, in the future, I will truthfully be able to state that x holds, is it also true that, right now, I can truthfully state that, in the future, x will hold? Of course the latter implies the former, but the former does not imply the latter, unless we live in a strictly deterministic universe in which there is only one possibility for the course of events subsequent to this moment.\'94 \
\
I beamed with pride at the machinations of my favorite logic student. The elder parrot\'92s expression did not change. \'93So\'94, he said, \'93is it false that we will kill you?\'94 Hendrix came back with the quick response: \'93It might be that, in the future, it will be true that you have killed me, but that does not imply that it is true now that you will kill me, unless I know that I am in the specific universe containing a future in which I am expired at your pleasure. Thus, it is not true and therefore it is false.\'94\
\
\
\
With a sickening lurch of the stomach I realized that I had not taught Hendrix probability theory. She was making a mortal error in assuming that anything not true had to be false, as it could merely be uncertain but still strongly probable. This I felt was a better summary of the present situation and I felt angry with myself that I had not at least introduced Hendrix to Kolmogorov\'92s axioms for the probability calculus. The elder parrot\'92s sides started to shake. His eye started to twitch, and flecks of froth appeared at the corner of his beak. He threw his head back and howled with laughter, howled like a wolf howls at the monthly moon. His four disciples also laughed, at first with childish giggles and then with a persistent wail made up of correlated shrieks that soon began to resonate like a siren with a fixed frequency, higher then lower then higher again. The wind, already strong and persistent, began to rotate about this unholy site with the same frequency as the parrot chicks\'92 laughter. Trees bent inwards towards this vortex, and at the locus of it stood the elder parrot, still howling in catastrophic disharmony with the four unnamed chicks. One by one, they were sucked into the eye of the storm, into the chest of the elder parrot, where they accumulated into a many-headed morass of wriggling agitation, transforming the elder parrot into a swollen hydra of monstrous proportions.\
\
\'93Good grief\'94, I said, clinging to the looping root of a mangrove tree. \
\
\
\
I then turned to watch as Hendrix herself was inhaled into the ravenous chest of the elder parrot and trapped there in a kind of translucent putty with her four siblings broiling in a fleshy maelstrom around her. \'93Bugger\'94, I yelled in the general direction of the elder parrot. The ground beneath me trembled as, with a single stride the looming shoggothic monster stepped across the dais towards me. It was confronted by Torkel Knutsson, who growled ferociously, baring his sharp incisors at the elder parrot. Brave Torkel Knutsson! You shall not be forgotten! \
\
\
\
Seeing as the wind had died down, I used the split second granted me by Torkel Knutsson\'92s intervention to run away. I didn\'92t look back. But I heard a sharp canine yelp followed by a noisy sucking and crunching. Then there was a belch, and the ground beneath me shook once again with what I assumed must be the elder parrots\'92 loping canter. I bolted in the direction of the nest, dismayed at how out of breath I was becoming and cursing my sedentary forest lifestyle. \'93Good grief\'94, I panted to myself, \'93fifty days and not a single sit-up. You\'92ve really done it this time, lad.\'94 \
\
\
\
At this dramatic juncture I was struck by a memory of one of my school friends, Nasty Nick, who smoked some marijuana and then hallucinated that Donald Duck was chasing him. I also thought about that scene in Jurassic Park III when a pterodactyl chases a man across a rickety bridge. It is strange how the mind makes connections. I reached the nest. There was a single egg left from my original brood. I snatched the egg, stuffed it into my shirt where it rested against my skin, and with a leap I plunged into the great brown river that surged past the campsite.\
\
\
\
I swam to the great ivory ladder that stood like a sentry in the rushing water. Grabbing onto the lowest rung, I frantically pulled my sodden body up and away from this enervating jungle. I heard a great splash as the elder parrot, too heavy to fly, waded into the river behind me and paddled in titanic athletic strokes towards the protruding ladder. The rungs trembled as the elder parrot mounted the ladder and began to climb. A stench of rotten offal drifted up from his snarling maw and made me retch with fear. I vomited into my own mouth, swallowed, and continued to scramble upwards.\
\
\
\
So this is it, I thought to myself. This is my denouement. Chased up a ladder and eaten by a mutant parrot. This is worse than all the other scrapes, worse than that time I was benighted on a mountain in Slovakia, worse than that time I was beaten up by a gang of inebriated chavs in Stoke-on-Trent, worse even than the time I was bitten on the toe by a Corsican fox. This is more disorientating than all those epileptic fits where I woke up in a different place to the one I\'92d gone to sleep in, this is more debilitating than all the sleepless nights and more humiliating than all the female rejection. This is the end zone, these are my twilight seconds, here I teeter at the intersection where inanimate matter meets intelligent life. \
\
\
\
Then I had an epiphany. It went something like this:\
\
\
\
I AM MATTER\
\
\
\
Yes, I thought to myself, I am bare condensed matter and to matter I\'92ll return, and it was only with the imminent threat of the extinction of my consciousness that I could truly appreciate this fact. I am matter, and my whole personality is constrained by my physical state, and my physical state is at the mercy of this ravenous devil, and this ravenous devil is just going to ingest me so that the ordered material that constitutes my person will relax into a perfectly spavined equilibrium. At this juncture, a thought bubbled up and took me by surprise with the manner in which it flashed upon the monitor of my mind:\
\
\
\
THAT ACTUALLY SOUNDS QUITE PLEASANT.\
\
\
\
What? What was I thinking now? That I want to be reduced back to disordered biomass? Yes, that thought struck me then as a decidedly uncomplicated and stress-free conclusion to the whole sorry misery of my human experience. To be extinguished just like that, to be materialized, to experience the honest reduction to my hardware with no illusory software, yes that was the true enlightenment I was missing. Death by mutant parrot began to take on a glowing allure in my mind that seduced me intellectually, and I made a snap decision there to just let it happen. \
\
\
\
All this flashed through my mind in a matter of moments, so I halted my climb, now rather looking forward to my spectacular expiration. I turned to face my pursuer, now roaring up the ladder, eating up the distance between us with great sinewy lurches. I smiled. \
\
\
\
Then something extraordinary happened. The elder parrot was a few inches away and I was expectantly inhaling its heady aroma, when it appeared to hit some sort of invisible, unyielding wall. I saw close-up what happens to a beak when it hits a wall at 30mph. It was instructive. The head of the elder parrot burst open, and it died. Then, with soundless majesty it dropped like a stone into the distant river, and was swallowed up by that roiling torrent. \
\
\
\
I stared down at the tropics from my elevated spot, bemused. In one second my emotions slipped from euphoria to black depression, and I burst into tears for my lost opportunity, for my lost experience. Then I sadly turned, and with bloodshot eyes I resumed my ascent out of the second plain above the plenum, and the exterior of the last parrot egg felt cool against my skin.\

[1] The language of Dog is tonal, and involves the words \'93rowr-roorowr-rowrruff\'94 expressed at many thousands of different frequency combinations within the canine range of hearing. This range, spanning about 10 \'bd different octaves, includes some frequencies the human ear cannot hear. For the most part, however, Dog is spoken at frequencies lying in the human range of 20-20,000Hz and so humans can also understand it. The upper range of the language is mainly used to express philosophical ideas, which is why conversations with dogs rarely veer from literal descriptions of practical topics of immediate significance. It is true that dogs often make other sounds beside \'93rowr-roorowr-rowrruff\'94 , but these have no linguistic interpretation and should be regarded as mere animal noises.\
