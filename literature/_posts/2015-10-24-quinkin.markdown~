**Verses 1-3**

I’m covering my sex up with neoprene, <br>
Gonna knock out all my teeth for some whale baleen, <br>
Yeah, my gums are bleeding heavy, but my head feels clean, <br>
I’m gonna be the woman of the sea.

I’m stringing sheets of algae up between my limbs, <br>
Gonna flap them to the wailing of the sea lions’ hymns, <br>
Yeah, the gods are in the treetops, but the gospel swims, <br>
I’m gonna be the woman of the sea.

I screwed a moray eel in a dank moraine, <br>
Yeah, the squalor tasted succulent as sugarcane, <br>
I sucked up all the filthiness, and with it came the pain, <br>
The pain inside the woman of the sea.

**Chorus**

Ahhhh...

**Verses 4-6**

I did battle with the kraken for my squid mouth soup, <br>
Yeah, he pulled me by the coat tails on a loop-de-loop, <br>
I shimmied, but that decapod was tough to dupe, <br>
He could shimmy like the woman of the sea.

I cut a mermaid’s skull into a diadem, <br>
All fortified with faucet-fulls of oyster phlegm, <br>
I declare myself the sea princess, carpe diem, <br>
There’s a princess in this woman of the sea.

My lungs are out of air; I’ve got to surface quick, <br>
But the water’s black and I can’t tell which way to kick, <br>
The final curve I paddle is parabolic, <br>
And I go to sleep a woman of the sea... <br>
Because the sea forever shares a bed with me.

**Chorus**

Ahhhh...
