Hordes In the Cold Place

Verse
The hordes are in the cold place,
They glibber in my ear,
A black iron grille divides us still,
But they can smell my fear.

The hordes are in the cold place,
We keep them out with pine,
My loved ones huddle round the fire,
The hordes, they scratch and whine.

Bridge

Chorus 1
Oh, they hear my heartbeat,
They hear my vessels booming.

Oh, they need the fresh meat,
They know the feast is looming.

Bridge

Verse
Beneath the hut, a staircase 
Leads to miles of corridor,
And at the end are caged lion-things
That gnaw their bellies raw.

And I can fly in this place,
I perch atop their cell,
The lion-things are tortured
And they call the hordes to hell.

The hordes pour from the cold place,
Descend, my loves, descend,
My loves are chased by grizzle-bears 
Down every twist and bend.

Bridge

Chorus 2
Oh, they hunt the quarry,
The raptorhood impels them.

Run, or you’ll be sorry,
Hot blood, hot blood propels them.

Hot from the bone, the hordes they moan
And their lips are moist…

Oh, your people flounder,
The tiger takes the hindmost.

Oh, the hordes surround her,
The one you love the most is…
Gone…

Bridge

Verse
The hordes came from the cold place,
Their forked tongues flick the air,
In waves they pour with clicking claws
And yellow eyes that stare.

Now to my stuffy rookery,
I swoop and close my eyes,
But the glibbering grows louder
As I hear the legions rise…
