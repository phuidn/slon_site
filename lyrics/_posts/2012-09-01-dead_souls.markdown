**Verse 1**<br>

Drawn by a carriage, the driver a hunchback,<br>
Our hero was set on his way.<br>
His father would tell him to trust in the penny,<br>
And make insincerity pay.<br>
So he’d only make friends as a means to an end,<br>
And he’d pay his respects to the rich,<br>
But all his plans failed, before he found a way<br>
He could satisfy his cosmic itch.<br>

**Chorus 1**<br>

What is it Chichikov, what were you thinking of?<br>
Dead Souls.<br>
What is it Chichikov, what were you thinking of?<br>
Dead Souls.<br>

**Verse 2**<br>

His best years behind him, he spotted a loophole,<br>
That sealed his ultimate fate.<br>
He’ll buy up your dead, and you’ll be tax exempt,<br>
Then he’ll mortgage the lot to the state.<br>
And oh, when they thought he was rolling in green,<br>
They would hang on his high cultured breath,<br>
It wasn’t ‘til after he charmed them they found out<br>
His business depended on death!<br>

**Chorus 2**<br>

What is it Chichikov, what were you thinking of?<br>
Dead Souls.<br>
What is it Chichikov, what were you thinking of?<br>
Dead Souls.<br>

What is it Chichikov, what were you thinking of?<br>
Dance like a fidget on fiery coals,<br>
What is it Chichikov, what were you thinking of?<br>
Coming to town for the deeds to dead souls.<br>

**Verse 3**<br>

Soft, the word bled that our hero was implicated <br>
In a ghoulish wrong.<br>
The ladies despised him, officials chastised him,<br>
But he carried on with the song.<br>
And oh, the road takes him, so they will forget him,<br>
And vaguely remember his crime.<br>
He thought he could settle, but they wouldn’t let him,<br>
He freaked out too many this time!<br>

**Bridge**<br>

Send him a messenger, send him a sign,<br>
He is breaking.<br>
Back to the first square, and now with no time,<br>
Ah, he’s aching.<br>

**Chorus 3**<br>

What is it Chichikov, what were you thinking of?<br>
Dead Souls.<br>
What is it Chichikov, what were you thinking of?<br>
Dead Souls.<br>

What is it Chichikov, what were you thinking of?<br>
Dance like a fidget on fiery coals,<br>
What is it Chichikov, what were you thinking of?<br>
Coming to town for the deeds to dead souls.<br>

What is it Chichikov, what were you thinking of?<br>
Dance like a fidget on fiery coals,<br>
What is it Chichikov, what were you thinking of?<br>
Coming to town for the deeds to dead souls.<br>
