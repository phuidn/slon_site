**Verse 1**

Drawn by a carriage, the driver a hunchback,
Our hero was set on his way.
His father would tell him to trust in the penny,
And make insincerity pay.
So he’d only make friends as a means to an end,
And he’d pay his respects to the rich,
But all his plans failed, before he found a way
He could satisfy his cosmic itch.

**Chorus 1**

What is it Chichikov, what were you thinking of?
Dead Souls.
What is it Chichikov, what were you thinking of?
Dead Souls.

**Verse 2**

His best years behind him, he spotted a loophole,
That sealed his ultimate fate.
He’ll buy up your dead, and you’ll be tax exempt,
Then he’ll mortgage the lot to the state.
And oh, when they thought he was rolling in green,
They would hang on his high cultured breath,
It wasn’t ‘til after he charmed them they found out
His business depended on death!

**Chorus 2**

What is it Chichikov, what were you thinking of?
Dead Souls.
What is it Chichikov, what were you thinking of?
Dead Souls.

What is it Chichikov, what were you thinking of?
Dance like a fidget on fiery coals,
What is it Chichikov, what were you thinking of?
Coming to town for the deeds to dead souls.

**Verse 3**

Soft, the word bled that our hero was implicated 
In a ghoulish wrong.
The ladies despised him, officials chastised him,
But he carried on with the song.
And oh, the road takes him, so they will forget him,
And vaguely remember his crime.
He thought he could settle, but they wouldn’t let him,
He freaked out too many this time!

**Bridge**

Send him a messenger, send him a sign,
He is breaking.
Back to the first square, and now with no time,
Ah, he’s aching.

**Chorus 3**

What is it Chichikov, what were you thinking of?
Dead Souls.
What is it Chichikov, what were you thinking of?
Dead Souls.

What is it Chichikov, what were you thinking of?
Dance like a fidget on fiery coals,
What is it Chichikov, what were you thinking of?
Coming to town for the deeds to dead souls.

What is it Chichikov, what were you thinking of?
Dance like a fidget on fiery coals,
What is it Chichikov, what were you thinking of?
Coming to town for the deeds to dead souls.
