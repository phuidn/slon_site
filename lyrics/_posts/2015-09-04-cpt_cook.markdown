**Intro**

**Verse 1**

The Greenwich light is dappled, it reminds me
Of sun-swung seas,
Swinging softly in my muscle memories...
I swagger with my sailor’s gait 
From dinner to soiree,
“Our Cook’s the man who mapped the world”,
The London dailies say.
The Earl of Sandwich dines me, he says
“Cook must you resign?
We have ships bound for the North-West Passage,
Ask, and they’ll be thine.”

**Bridge**

I can’t stand it, so I stand and fix the party with my eyes...
“My Lords:
If so commanded I will undertake to lead this enterprise.”

**Chorus 1**

Bring me my guns, bring me my sextant...
Bring me the iceberg frosted waves...
Bring me my wilderness of water...
It’s a wilderness of graves.

Tis I...
Tis I...

**Verse 2**

Elizabeth my love, I leave you staring from the docks,
The Resolution makes for Tonga, where I thread her through the rocks.
Aye, there this Yorkshire farm boy is the supreme autocrat,
Harass me at me South Sea throne; I’ll lash ye with me cat.
They steal from me, the natives stir, the Old One from his sleep.

**Bridge**

I’ll slice the biceps on their arms...
Til’ their bone marrows weep...

**Chorus 2**

Stand away, up North I pelt, 
A broth of Nootka Injun ice-melt 
Broiling...broiling...

Break upon the Chukchi Sea, 
Escape her frigid fingers coyly
Coiling...coiling...

We-ell the ship was spoiling so I pushed her hard to Hawaii,
There the natives sang my name out – Orono – and I was a deity...

Tis I...
Tis I...

**Verse 3**

I feasted with King Terreoboo by the whitewashed moon,
He sent us off with accolades, but we returned too soon.
When they stole a wooden cutter, I declared a state of war,
I went to fetch their King for hostage
On that sacred shore...

**Death Sequence**

Of a pearly morning, captain’s coming,
And through the trees I feel the drumming,
From the throng, a lone Hawaiian
Leers grim and shows me iron,
Small shot bounces off his shield,
Mortal man, I am revealed!
A final act, a final scene, 
A death for every slow marine,
Retreat with dignity, retreat, ah!
Clubbed to my knees, I falter,
Oh my mind, my skull-swung head,
The dizzy waves are churning red,
The dagger drawn, a neck of knife,
Diverts my air, it drinks my life!

**Bridge**

And I fall face down on the sun-swung seas, they

**Verse 3 Continued**

Stultify, my pumping life, they pull it from my chest...

**Bridge**

I pass to where the gyrfalcons...
And the Gods go to rest...

**Epilogue**

We ate your heart, but no hard feelings, Lono...
Lono, we set your mana free...
When you coming, back to visit, Lono?
Lono, fulfill the prophecy...

**Outro**
