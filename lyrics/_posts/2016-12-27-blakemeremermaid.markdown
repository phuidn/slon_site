Come you up to Blake Mere<br>
Blacker than a banker’s conscience<br>
Come you up to Blake Mere<br>
Dark depths, deeper than a mother’s concern.<br>
Come you amorous<br>
Lads to the black pool<br>
Come you lovers of<br>
Biddulph and Froghall,<br>
Come at midnight, she awaits you theer,<br>
The mermaid of the mere.<br>

Briny white horses break hard on the reef<br>
And the spray hits the lips of a siren, in mid-motif<br>
Find me, lover, be the man<br>
For a naked nymph in the Straits of Magellan!<br>

...Hark...<br>
Cleft into two, the mist parts for her majesty’s bark ...<br>
Mercian sailor says “come, my seductive skylark...<br>
Come with me, you appear to be unseasonably nesh.<br>

The Blake Mere is limpid, warm, and fathomless.”<br>

Flushed in a muscular tryst,<br>
A tantric red-blooded pink mist,<br>
They lay in the reeds...<br>
But the plenum feeds,<br>
On mortal man’s demise,<br>
She cannot age, he fades. he dies,<br>
He dies.<br>
Lovelorn and trapped, she lingers theer,<br>
In theer...<br>
The wallowing widow of the mere.<br>

Joshua Linnet was wild as a hailstorm,<br>
He spied a fair lady and lusted for her pale form,<br>
“Marry me, will you”,<br>
She said “away with you”.<br>
So he took her arm, and whispered to her “listen dear,<br>
They say a witch floats, let’s see how you fare in the Mere.”<br>

...Quick...<br>
Swallowed by darkness, the fair lady sunk like a brick...<br>
Then up rose the mermaid, ovulating and apoplectic...<br>

“Curse you Joshua Linnet, you men are all the same,<br>
You‘re all bloody scam artists, I know your game.<br>
This lake is quaggy and cold,<br>
He said it was bottomless,<br>
‘Tis six feet deep at best,<br>
And he left me here, frustrated and depressed...<br>
Depressed...<br>
Man...<br>
Meet your death...”<br>

With sickle-sharp talons,<br>
She butchered that felon,<br>
Then dove, and not a ripple<br>
Did betray her presence,<br>
Theer she waits...<br>
