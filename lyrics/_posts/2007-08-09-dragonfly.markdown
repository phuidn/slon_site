The lakeside pond besheathed by weeds<br>
And footprints scraped the churn’d mud<br>
That laced the banks, and laced the dream<br>
Was by the salivated cud<br>
That which would tumble, molar-ride,<br>
Curtailed and curtained by thin lips,<br>
Lips arid, never moisture’s host,<br>
Yet from these jaws some pondslime drips<br>

And from these jaws no croak’d tones<br>
Dared break the crickets buzzing near,<br>
For silent backlegs squatted low,<br>
And damp, they played a tuneless peer.<br>

Reached out in river-mist and buzz<br>
Did silent squatter, gleamed his eyes,<br>
And boggled they with beauty’s awe,<br>
Upon the dancing dragonflies,<br>
Flew tongue, it flew, the marble tip<br>
Slid mucus through the humid haze<br>
And drew the darting demon back<br>
Yet on it he could only gaze,<br>
Twas swallowed not, and quick unslicked,<br>
But died a turmoil, river-Zeus<br>
Did not for luncheon snare the hide,<br>
For this preserved another use,<br>
Snapped wings with nimble fingers were,<br>
The webb’d grasp worked through the day,<br>
And pulled, and weaved, intricacied,<br>
Til ‘fore the craftsman God-art lay.<br>

Was nothing more, was nothing less,<br>
Than nature’s cloak, the visage-cape,<br>
In lightning blue, but hemmed it was,<br>
With gossamer wings, base to nape.<br>

So Dragon-Fly Man’s goggle-gaze<br>
Did sparkle, did expunge with fire,<br>
And for his life-work creaked he up<br>
Til sick with eye-glut he spread higher,<br>
Cleared his ceiling: broke the mist,<br>
And taking up his scaly cloak<br>
A stiff outstretched arm, clammy fist<br>
In widowed time the laws it broke.<br>

For not one was the sickly pond,<br>
Without and mud framed for mud’s sake,<br>
But Mud-Student in rapture flew<br>
And only did his heart he take.<br>
