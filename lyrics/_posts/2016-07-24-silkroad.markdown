**Intro**

An attentive ear, dear traveller, <br>
For the tale a pauper sings, <br>
Of a man who roamed the Xinjiang sands, <br>
A man called the silk road king. <br>
An attentive ear, dear traveller, <br>
For the tale a pauper sings, <br>
Look upon the barren Xinjiang sands, <br>
Through the eyes of the silk road king.

**Verse 1**

Your sweet dictator in the sky, calls you <br>
He offers you his purple hand, <br>
Steal unto him the subtle ribbon of the Djinn, <br>
You are a fresh thief in a foreign land.

**Verse 2**

Your sweet dictator visits in a dream, <br>
He teaches you his final verse, <br>
Take it as licence to accost the caravans, <br>
For they are rolling out a godless curse. <br>

**Interlude**

Roll down the Tarim to the cavern of the Djinn, <br>
The Djinn that blisters with a smokeless flame, <br>
Retrieve the ribbon from his caustic mandibles, <br>
Now you possess the adversary’s name.

You’ve never known such strength before, <br>
Never felt so juiced, never so assured, <br>
Ride on the chariot of absolute omniscience, <br>
The silk road shall fall to the sword. <br>

Now raise from the ashes a citadel of gleaming stone, <br>
And minarets aimed at the moon, <br>
The emperor fears you, and you hear the old one: <br>
“Soon, I shall come to you soon.”

**Verse 3**

Your sweet dictator slithers in your bones, <br>
Your people supplicate and cower, <br>
Their land was stolen, and now you steal their minds, <br>
You took the Word and made it power.
