Woman of the Sea

Verses 1-3
I’m covering my sex up with neoprene,
Gonna knock out all my teeth for some whale baleen,
Yeah, my gums are bleeding heavy, but my head feels clean,
I’m gonna be the woman of the sea.

I’m stringing sheets of algae up between my limbs,
Gonna flap them to the wailing of the sea lions’ hymns,
Yeah, the gods are in the treetops, but the gospel swims,
I’m gonna be the woman of the sea.

I screwed a moray eel in a dank moraine,
Yeah, the squalor tasted succulent as sugarcane,
I sucked up all the filthiness, and with it came the pain,
The pain inside the woman of the sea.

Chorus
Ahhhh…

Verses 4-6
I did battle with the kraken for my squid mouth soup,
Yeah, he pulled me by the coat tails on a loop-de-loop,
I shimmied, but that decapod was tough to dupe,
He could shimmy like the woman of the sea.

I cut a mermaid’s skull into a diadem,
All fortified with faucet-fulls of oyster phlegm,
I declare myself the sea princess, carpe diem,
There’s a princess in this woman of the sea.

My lungs are out of air; I’ve got to surface quick,
But the water’s black and I can’t tell which way to kick,
The final curve I paddle is parabolic,
And I go to sleep a woman of the sea…
Because the sea forever shares a bed with me.

Chorus
Ahhhh…
