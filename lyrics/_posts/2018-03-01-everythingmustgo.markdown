Well you can lose your clothes to start with, babe,<br>
Then maybe lose your eyes,<br>
Lose your skin and clitoris,<br>
Yeah, that'll cut you down to size.<br>
When you're trussed up and eviscerated,<br>
Frozen, good to go,<br>
Then you'll know,<br>
Then you will know<br>
Why everything must go.<br>

Well you can lose your inhibitions, babe,<br>
Then maybe lose your shame,<br>
Lose your pride and self-respect,<br>
Then lose your fortune and your fame.<br>
When you're crying with humiliation,<br>
Do it in my name,<br>
So I'll know,<br>
You love me so,<br>
Oh! Everything must go.<br>

It's time to end the human race,<br>
Bring on the pestilence and war,<br>
It's a matter of perspective,<br>
No-one needs this any more.<br>
And you tell me Jesus loves me,<br>
But the devil needs me more,<br>
What a blow,<br>
Oh what a blow,<br>
God's angels got to go.<br>

Throw out the baby with the bathwater,<br>
The end of times is nigh,<br>
See the welling of the rivers,<br>
And the swelling of the skies.<br>
And the virgin mother's growing wings<br>
To get that legal high,<br>
What a show,<br>
Come to the show,<br>
Roll up, everything must go.<br>

There will be seventy-two virgins<br>
Coming blood and crying piss,<br>
All the Catholics a-masturbating,<br>
Down in the abyss.<br>
Even Baphomet is baffled<br>
He says: 'what the hell is this?'<br>
Now I know,<br>
Now I know,<br>
Why everything must go.<br>
Now I know,<br>
Now I know,<br>
Why everything must go.<br>
