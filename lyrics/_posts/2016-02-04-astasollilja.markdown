**Section 1**

When the blizzard ceased to blow,<br>
He found his croft submerged in snow,<br>
And his mangy dog was yowling in the dark.<br>
He scrabbled round for matches, lit the lamp,<br> 
And in the feeble light it gave,<br> 
He discerned his Rosa,<br>
Still, congealed with blood.<br>
The corpse lay on the floor, and in the bed,<br>
Bjartur saw a baby’s face,<br>
Scrunched up eyes and mottled skin,<br>
Like a new-born old man.<br>
It lay beneath the belly of the dog,<br>
The infant whimpered and subsisted on<br>
That ember-glow of warmth.

**Bridge 1**

Poor little thing…

**Section 2**

Sing, with the note that you have won,<br>
Ásta Sóllilja.<br>
You shall be called the lily of the sun,<br>
Ásta Sóllilja.

Sprout up a willowy maiden, with raven<br>
Hair, a cast in one eye,<br>
Nuzzle the magical place on your daddy’s neck,<br>
When you want to cry

Tears for the future, no tutor no, no<br>
Christian salvation for you,<br>
Learn the Jomsviking Rhymes first,<br>
When the right time comes,<br>
You shall see town in the 

Spring, with the lily blossom of the sun,<br>
Ásta Sóllilja.<br>
Sing, for the lily white life begun,<br>
Ásta Sóllilja.

Bathe in the dew, the moon lights your<br>
Nakedness, on the night before<br>
You see the ladies of town and the<br> 
Ocean, and you gaze in awe.

Lying next to daddy at the inn,<br>
You turn, you wriggle up close to him, you<br>
Don’t know know why.<br>
Turns out that your daddy isn’t sleeping,<br> 
You feel his hand creeping, you feel his hand<br>
On your thigh!

No! I am an independent man…<br>
No! I am beholden to no human…<br>
No! I am an independent man…<br>
No! I am beholden to no human…<br>
Flower.

**Fill 1**

Bjartur left the frightened flower of his life,<br>
He went to load the cart, he left her<br> 
Cowering in the dark.<br>
Bjartur marched his flower homewards in the rain,<br>
She ripped her dress and vomited,<br>
Then vomited again.

**Bridge 2**

Strange little thing…

**Section 3**

Wilt, for the foggy winter has begun,<br>
Ásta Sóllilja.<br>
How could you understand what you have done?<br>
Ásta Sóllilja.

Daddy departs, but sends up a poet<br>
Of love on the heath.<br>
Quivering lass, your cast eye is ancient,<br>
It sees underneath

Words whispered covertly, in a spectral dirge,<br>
This wordsmith, shall grant your wish,<br>
He can’t resist the urge…

He took her!<br>
He took her!<br>
He took her!<br>
He plucked the…flower.

**Fill 2**

How could you comprehend what he has done?<br>
Ásta Sóllilja.<br>
Cast from the croft to perdition,<br>
Ásta Sóllilja.

Tell her from me that when I die, she may<br>
Happily lay me out,<br>
Tell him from me that when I die, he may<br>
Bury my carrion…

No more pity, I consent to no dumb charity not accorded ordinary mortals,<br>
I am more than half a human…<br>
Fie on your heathen<br>
Doggerel…

No! I am an independent woman…<br>
No! I am beholden to no human…<br>
No! I am an independent woman…<br>
No! I am beholden to no human…<br>
Crofter.

**Fill 3**

**Section 4**

Aaah…<br>
Aaah…<br>
Bjartur lifted up the flower of his life…<br>
Aaah…

Lily of the sun.
