**Section 1**

When the blizzard ceased to blow,<br>
He found his croft submerged in snow,
And his mangy dog was yowling in the dark.
He scrabbled round for matches, lit the lamp, 
And in the feeble light it gave, 
He discerned his Rosa,
Still, congealed with blood.
The corpse lay on the floor, and in the bed,
Bjartur saw a baby’s face,
Scrunched up eyes and mottled skin,
Like a new-born old man.
It lay beneath the belly of the dog,
The infant whimpered and subsisted on
That ember-glow of warmth.

**Bridge 1**

Poor little thing…

**Section 2**

Sing, with the note that you have won,
Ásta Sóllilja.
You shall be called the lily of the sun,
Ásta Sóllilja.

Sprout up a willowy maiden, with raven
Hair, a cast in one eye,
Nuzzle the magical place on your daddy’s neck,
When you want to cry

Tears for the future, no tutor no, no
Christian salvation for you,
Learn the Jomsviking Rhymes first,
When the right time comes,
You shall see town in the 

Spring, with the lily blossom of the sun,
Ásta Sóllilja.
Sing, for the lily white life begun,
Ásta Sóllilja.

Bathe in the dew, the moon lights your
Nakedness, on the night before
You see the ladies of town and the 
Ocean, and you gaze in awe.

Lying next to daddy at the inn,
You turn, you wriggle up close to him, you
Don’t know know why.
Turns out that your daddy isn’t sleeping, 
You feel his hand creeping, you feel his hand
On your thigh!

No! I am an independent man…
No! I am beholden to no human…
No! I am an independent man…
No! I am beholden to no human…
Flower.

**Fill 1**

Bjartur left the frightened flower of his life,
He went to load the cart, he left her 
Cowering in the dark.
Bjartur marched his flower homewards in the rain,
She ripped her dress and vomited,
Then vomited again.

**Bridge 2**

Strange little thing…

**Section 3**

Wilt, for the foggy winter has begun,
Ásta Sóllilja.
How could you understand what you have done?
Ásta Sóllilja.

Daddy departs, but sends up a poet
Of love on the heath.
Quivering lass, your cast eye is ancient,
It sees underneath

Words whispered covertly, in a spectral dirge,
This wordsmith, shall grant your wish,
He can’t resist the urge…

He took her!
He took her!
He took her!
He plucked the…flower.

**Fill 2**

How could you comprehend what he has done?
Ásta Sóllilja.
Cast from the croft to perdition,
Ásta Sóllilja.

Tell her from me that when I die, she may
Happily lay me out,
Tell him from me that when I die, he may
Bury my carrion…

No more pity, I consent to no dumb charity not accorded ordinary mortals,
I am more than half a human…
Fie on your heathen
Doggerel…

No! I am an independent woman…
No! I am beholden to no human…
No! I am an independent woman…
No! I am beholden to no human…
Crofter.

**Fill 3**

**Section 4**

Aaah…
Aaah…
Bjartur lifted up the flower of his life…
Aaah…

Lily of the sun.
