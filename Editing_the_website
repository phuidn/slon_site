# Allows you to view changes made to the website to make sure that it works
# before committing to Github, which will publish the website with the 
# changes.
jekyll build
jekyll serve

# Commits to the Github repository. Put some text where "Added swans." is to say 
# something about the version.
git commit -a -m "Added swans."
git push

If you have small page fragments that you wish to include in multiple places on 
your site, you can use the include tag.
{% include footer.html %}

Jekyll expects all include files to be placed in an _includes directory at the 
root of your source directory. This will embed the contents of 
<source>/_includes/footer.html into the calling file.
