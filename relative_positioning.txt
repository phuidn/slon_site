The two .css options "z-index" and "position" and their arguments can be used 
to specify which items stand in the foreground and which are shunted to the 
background. High z-index values mean items are positioned to the fore, low 
values aft. The values seem to range from +10000 to -10000. Currently I have 
all the lightbox stuff set at 

.lightboxOverlay {
  position: absolute;
  z-index: 10000;
  ...other options...
}

.lightbox {
  position: absolute;
  z-index: 10000;
  ...other options...
}

.lb-nav {
  position: absolute;
  z-index: 9999;
  ...other options...
}

, so the lb-nav is a little behind the lightboxOverlay and lightbox, but 
they're all pretty much at the fore. They are also positioned absolutely.

For the menu in _sass/layout.css we've got:

.site-header {
    position: relative;
    z-index : 9000;
    ...other options...
}

, so it's position is relative, but its z-index value is lower than any of the 
lightbox stuff. I'm not sure how this gets us what we want: the menu always at 
the fore, except when the lightbox viewer is being used, but it appears to work.
